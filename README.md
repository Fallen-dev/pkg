# pkg
Pkg is yet another package manager for the Arch Linux system purely written in Haskell programming language.

Pkg is inspired by _pamac_ package manager which is used on Manjaro OS. Pkg is yet very simple to use and fast package manager.

#### Pkg uses both pacman and aura. Aura is for aur support though building and installing aur packages will be implemented on pkg later.

> This is an ongoing project.
